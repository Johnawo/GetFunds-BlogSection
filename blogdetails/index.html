        Is Crowdfunding Good for Investors? YES! And here's why <br/>

1. A well-diversified investment portfolio <br/>
Remember the saying about putting all eggs in one basket? <br/>
Experts do not recommend giving all your crowdfunding funds to just one company and advise on picking  <br/>
several companies in order to divide your money between them. This practice is called a portfolio <br/>
diversification, and it comes as a rule of thumb, however, even in this case, it’s tough to mitigate the risk of <br/>
losing money. <br/>
<br/>

To minimize the probability of failure, carefully study the businesses you’re going to invest in. Carry out your <br/>
own customer due diligence (CDD), analyse a borrower’s background and examine the technical and financial <br/>
sides of a proposal. <br/>
<br/>

To keep your portfolio balanced and well-diversified, consider various crowdfunding patterns. You can opt for <br/>
GetFunds.ng and equity investments – every pattern has its crowdfunding benefits for investors. Study all the <br/>
nitty-gritty of a business model used by GetFunds.ng service provider and don’t be afraid to ask questions. <br/>
<br/>

2. Lucrative investments <br/>
Investors always seek opportunities with bigger benefits and lower risks. The potential of the crowdfunding <br/>
sector is huge – a lot of amazing campaigns have successfully closed with satisfying returns to early investors. <br/>
<br/>

Another positive thing about crowdfunding is its robustness. The crowdfunding sector is “an independent state <br/>
as it is not linked to other financial markets and thus remains stable in times of economic instability.
